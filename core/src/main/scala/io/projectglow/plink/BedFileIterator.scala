/**
 * Parses genotype blocks of a BED file. The iterator assumes that the input streams are currently at the beginning of a
 * genotype block.
 *
 * BED standard: https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/formats#bed
 *
 * This class does not currently support the entire BED standard. Limitations:
 * - Only variant-major BEDs are supported.
 *
 * @param stream Data stream that records are read from. Must be little-endian.
 * @param underlyingStream Hadoop input stream that underlies the little-endian data stream. Only
 *                         used for cleaning up when there are no genotype blocks left.
 * @param numBlocks The number of genotype blocks to be read. `hasNext` will return `false` once we've read `numBlocks`
 *                  blocks.
 * @param blockSize The size of a block in bytes; equal to `ceil(numSamples / 4)`
