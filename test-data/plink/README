To generate files, we used PLINK 1.9 (https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/).

The BED/BIM/FAM files under the directory bed-bim-fam were generated with MAP/PED files under the map-ped directory:
    plink --file map-ped/test --make-bed --out bed-bim-fam/test
These BED/BIM/FAM files were copied to the no-bim and no-fam directories.

The VCF file under the directory vcf was generated using with the BED/BIM/FAM files under the bed-bim-fam directory:
    plink --bfile bed-bim-fam/test --recode vcf --out vcf/test

The prematurely-truncated BED file under the directory malformed was generated by running the following commands on
the BED file from the bed-bim-fam directory:
    cp bed-bim-fam/test.bed malformed/test.bed
    truncate -s -1 malformed/test.bed
