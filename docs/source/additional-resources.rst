Running Databricks notebooks
----------------------------

Most of the code in the Databricks notebooks can be run on Spark and Glow alone, but some functions are only available
on Databricks. `Try Databricks for free <https://databricks.com/try-databricks>`_ and import the Databricks notebooks
following the
`Databricks documentation <https://docs.databricks.com/notebooks/notebooks-manage.html#import-a-notebook>`_.
